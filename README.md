# CiTIUS
Scripts completed during a stay at CiTIUS. There I conducted a bibliographic research on the state of the art in Natural Language Processing.
I also tested the capabilities of select Large Language Models in code generation and correction. Several
versions of GPT as well as open source models from the Hugging Face platform were studied.
